This repository is a bunch of web scraping projects that was created by me while taking an Udemy "Modern Web Scraping" course.\
The projects included:
1) Project 1 - first steps, getting some data from small online stores. Parsed some text (product names, prices) and links (either to images or to product pages). Implemented header spoofing for user-agent and auto-clicking "Next Page".
